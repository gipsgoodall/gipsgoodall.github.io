Check out this [Curiousity Article][Curiousity] for more info on the best time of day to exercise. 
Key thoughts: 

1. It's better to exercise in the morning, before you eat, if you're trying to lose weight because 
there is evidence that fasted cardio helps control appetite throughout the day. 

2. It's better to exercise in the afternoon/evening for high intensity activities and muscle strength and growth
because your muscles are warmer and testosterone levels higher.
