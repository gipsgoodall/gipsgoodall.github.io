The author of the website goes on to summarize the remaining chapters of the book and concludes:

"To summarize, the main things I’ve learned from this book are:

Journal writing is remarkable! It can help increase happiness through a variety of 
methods(writing about gratitude, reflecting on acts of kindness, analyzing traumas, 
imagining your best possible future self, goal-setting, etc.).

Variety is the spice of life! Whether we’re talking about being charitable, 
expressing gratitude, setting and striving for goals, make sure to vary your 
activities to get the most benefit."
