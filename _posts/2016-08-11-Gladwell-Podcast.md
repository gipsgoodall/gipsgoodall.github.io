Check out the Malcolm Gladwell Podcast, [Gladwell][Revisionist History]. The episodes I found of particular interest are
the three-part series about education: Carlos Doesn't Remember, Food Fight and My Little 
Hundred Million. 

The first episode deals with the difficulties of getting into college for students who come 
from poverty-stricken communities. The second episode discusses the choices colleges make 
around funding - which schools give more to low income students and the sacrifices one has to make. 
The third episode details Gladwell's thoughts on endowments and contrasts large donations 
to prestigious universities with Hank Rowan's 100 million dollar gift to little-known 
Glassboro State College in New Jersey. 

I don't think Gladwell's arguments are always well laid out or particularly convincing but the
podcasts are interesting and thought provoking, as Gladwell always is.
