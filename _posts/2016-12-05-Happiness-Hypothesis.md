In the [How to Become Happier][Haidt] section of his site. Jonathan Haidt discusses how to 
become happier using the following steps:

1. Diagnose Yourself
2. Improve Your Mental Hygiene (and physical health)
3. Improve Your Relatedness
4. Improve Your Work
5. Improve Your Connection to Something Beyond Yourself 


Check out [the Website][Haidt] to learn more about the book. The book is fantastic, one of the
best I have read on happiness. You can check it out on [Amazon here][Amazon].
